    "## Python Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Code readability is key, Python syntax itself is close to plain english.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your variables, functions should be given descriptive identifiers!\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers for variables should be descriptive words separated by underscores (not spaces) and in all lower case. Classes can use CamelCase.\n",
    "\n",
    "BAD: `var6 = 25`, `AG3ofMoTh3R = 25`. GOOD : `age_of_mother = 25`\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def optimize_animals(cats, dogs):\n",
    "\treturn cats ** 2 + np.sqrt(dogs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Not this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def feval(x, y):\n",
    "\treturn x**2+np.sqrt(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "   \n",
    "### White Space\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use white space to increase readability. Apply spacing around operators, except in function calls and slices. Also insert newlines if that makes sense logically, perhaps with insightful comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "BAD: `x=[2,3,4]`, GOOD: `x = [2, 3, 4]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Normalize x by adding 12\n",
    "x = x + 12  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Train on first 10 data points\n",
    "train(data[:10], bias=x)\n",

Please read this document: while we dont expect strict adherance to it, it will make your code readable by the entire python community.\n",

    "\n",
    "A question may arise: If you are expected to provide documentation in code-cells, what is the notebook markdown cell for? The answer is that it is for English and Math explanation of your process, and a very high level overview  and skeleton of the code, rather than details."
